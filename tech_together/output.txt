SUMMARY OF YOUR RIGHTS AS A TENANT:
We have reviewed your lease for possible violations in the following categories: 
(1) Landlord’s liability for loss or damage 
(2) The Warranty of Habitability
(3) The Covenant on Quiet Enjoyment 
(4) Maintenance and Repair 
(5) Payments and Fees 
(6) Termination of Tenancy and Eviction 
(7) Landlord’s Right of Entry

Your lease looks good, as far as we can tell, with no obvious legal violations. Still, let's review your rights!

(1) LANDLORD'S LIABILITY FOR LOSS OR DAMAGE
G.L.c. 186, §15 prohibits a landlord from waiving her liability for injuries, loss or damage, caused to tenants or third parties by her negligence, omission, or misconduct.
	Your lease does not seem to absolve the landlord of all liability for damage, which is good!

(2) WARRANTY OF HABITABILITY

In its landmark decision in Boston Housing Authority v. Hemingway, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court determined that when a landlord rents a residential unit under a written or oral lease, she makes an “implied warranty that the premises are fit for human occupation.
Your lease does not appear to contradict the warranty of habitability. (Note that even if it is not explicitly stated, it is implied under MA law). When your landlord rents to you, they are making an implied warranty that the premises are fit for human occupation and that there are no health and safety violations at the time of rental.
Since the warranty of habitability legally holds for all leases in MA. If your landlord does not keep your apartment in livable condition they have broken the warranty of habitation, and you may pursue legal action.

(3) COVENANT ON QUIET ENJOYMENT
According to the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts in Simon v. Solomon, the phrase 'quiet enjoyment' signifies 'the tenant’s right to freedom from serious interferences with his tenancy — acts or omissions that 'impair the character and value of the leased premises."  G.L.c.186, §14 penalizes any landlord who willfully fails to furnish water, hot water, heat, light, power, gas or other services, as required by law or contract; who directly or indirectly interferes with the furnishing of utilities or services or with the quiet enjoyment of any occupant in the premises; or who attempts to regain possession of such premises by force without judicial process. The section also prohibits a landlord from taking reprisals against a tenant who reports or issues proceedings against a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Eviction by the landlord, whether actual or constructive (i.e., any violation of landlord’s duties which effectively deprives the tenant of her enjoyment of the premises), constitutes a breach of the covenant of quiet enjoyment. Such a breach will entitle the tenant to triple damages or three months' rent (whichever is greater), as well as costs and attorney's fees. This covenant cannot be waived by the parties.
Your lease does not appear to contain language regarding the covenant of quiet enjoyment. In the absence of specific language, your rights to quiet enjoyment are implied under MA law.

(4) MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR
The landlord's and tenant's maintenance and repair responsibilities are mandated by the State Sanitary Code. The Code places most of the burden of providing and maintaining the premises in safe and habitable condition on the landlord, while imposing only minimal maintenance obligations on the tenant. The landlord's duties include, inter alia, providing and maintaining in good operating condition the water-heating facilities, electrical facilities, drinkable water, toilet and a sewage disposal system, and locks on entry doors. The landlord further bears responsibility to maintain structural elements in "good repair and in every way fit for the use intended"; and to install and "maintain free from leaks, obstructions or other defects" sinks, bathtubs, toilets, gas and water pipes, and other fixtures supplied by the landlord. Lastly, the landlord has an obligation to exercise reasonable care to ensure that the common areas under her control are reasonably well maintained(88). The tenant, on the other hand, only needs to “maintain free from leaks, obstructions and other defects" all "occupant owned and installed equipment" (89); to maintain “in a clean and sanitary condition […] that part of the dwelling which he exclusively occupies or controls"; and to "exercise reasonable care" in the use of the structural elements of the dwelling(91). Tenant's benefits, as set forth by the State Sanitary Code, cannot be waived under any residential lease. Finally, the State Sanitary Code includes a “repair and deduct” statute, aimed at enabling tenants to enforce landlords' compliance with the Code(93). It offers the tenant the ability to make repairs and lawfully deduct the cost incurred from the rent or, alternatively, to treat the lease as abrogated and vacate the premises within a reasonable time(94). These benefits cannot be waived by the parties.
Your lease does not appear to be neglecting to state the landlord’s duties. However, some leases subject the landlord’s and tenant’s obligations to applicable law, after misstating the division of duties by placing all of the repair duties on the tenant. Make sure that your lease contains an enforceable maintenance and repair clause.

(5) PAYMENT AND FEES
MA statutes prohibit landlords from requiring, at or prior to the commencement of the tenancy, any amount in excess of the first month’s rent, the last month’s rent, a security deposit equal to the first month’s rent, and the purchase and installation cost for a key and lock. Failure to comply with this provision constitutes “unfair or deceptive act.”
Your lease does not seem to contain any unenforceable clauses.

(6) TERMINATION OF TENANCY AND EVICTION
Since 1969, a landlord is required to give a 14 days’ notice in writing before terminating the lease due to non-payment of rent. A landlord is also prohibited from waiving the tenant’s right to cure the nonpayment by paying the amount owed within the statutory reinstatement period.
Your lease appears to fully inform you of your right to a 14 day period before your tenancy terminates in the event of an attempted eviction. However, your lease may be omitting the information that you can stop any eviction by paying the amount of rent owed before the 14 day period you are given is over. Be aware of this even if it is not mentioned in your lease!

(7) LANDLORD'S RIGHT OF ENTRY
The MA Legislature chose to restrict the landlord's right of access to the premises for the limited purposes set forth in the statute: to inspect the premises, make repairs, or show them to a prospective tenant, purchaser, mortgagee or its agents.
Your lease appears to follow MA law by stating that your landlord needs permission to enter your premises and for limited purposes.
